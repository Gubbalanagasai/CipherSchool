Introduction to OOPs

    Procedural Programming, 
    
    vs

    object Oriented Programming

Procedural Programming(POP)
 
    1.Derived from Structural Programming
    2.A program is divided into small parts called funtions
    3.Procedural programming follows top down approach
    4.Adding new data and function is not easy
    Examples: C, FORTRAN, Pascal, Basic etc

Object Oriented Programming(OOPs)

    1.OOPs is based on real world.
    2.Program is divided into small parts called objects
    3.Object oriented programming follows bottom up approach
    4.Adding new data and function is much easier
    Examples: C++, Java, Python, C# etc.

What are Objects?
    i.Anything that has a state and behaviour is known as an object.
    ii.Objects can be:
       Physical: Car, Laptop, pen etc
Classes can contain: 
                    .fields
                     .Methods
                     .Construtors
                     .Nested Class and interface

Creation of objects of a class(instantiation of a class):
                     .Known as instantiation of a class
                     .Objects share the attributes and the behavior of the class
